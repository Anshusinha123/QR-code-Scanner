# QR-code-Scanner

**Overview:**
The QR Code Scanner project is a Python-based application that utilizes OpenCV and Pyzbar to capture real-time video from a webcam and decode QR codes. It continuously scans for QR codes, extracts the embedded data, and displays it on the console. This project is useful for various applications, such as inventory management, authentication systems, and digital payments.

**Objective:**

The main objectives of this project are:
1.	Real-Time QR Code Detection – Capture live video and detect QR codes in real-time.
2.	QR Code Decoding – Extract and display the data stored in the QR code.
3.	User-Friendly Interface – Provide a simple interface to scan QR codes easily.
4.	Efficient Processing – Ensure quick response times while scanning and decoding QR codes.
5.	Camera Control – Implement a method to start, stop, and release the camera resources properly.
